this API are output in epoch time format.\n\nEpoch time (also known as POSIX time or Unix time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds.\n\nIt is valuable for developers as it automatically incorporates daylight savings time and time zones. \n\nThere are several functions in most programming languages for converting epoch time into a human readable format.\n\nFor more information on epoch time please visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) "}]},{"title":"Planned Outages","markdown":"The current planned outages are available at this URL\n\n>
