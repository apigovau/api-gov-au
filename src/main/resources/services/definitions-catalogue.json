There is [web version of the catalogue](https://definitions.ausdx.tk) that mirrors the functionality of this API.

In general, the API uri's follow the same pattern as the web ones but with the '/api/' path segment removed.

For example:

- http://definitions.ausdx.tk/definition/other/de55
- http://definitions.ausdx.tk/api/definition/other/de55

So to get an easy head start on what you can do wit the API, head over to the web version and take a look.
