# Taxpayer declarations in ATO SBR services

If you are lodging on behalf of a taxpayer, or interacting electronically with the ATO on their behalf, the law requires you to obtain a declaration from them first.

There are legal requirements on retaining declarations. You should [read the ATO article on taxpayer declarations](https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-professionals/prepare-and-lodge/managing-your-lodgment-program/client-declarations-and-lodgment-online/#Answerstofrequentlyaskedquestions) if you are unsure.

Here are some example declarations that you can use.
Make sure to read when each can be used, as they aren't all acceptable in every circumstance.


## Generic lodgement

> **Privacy**
> The ATO is authorised by the *Taxation Administration Act 1953* to request the provision of tax file numbers (TFNs). The ATO will use the TFNs to identify you in our records. It is not an offence to not provide the TFNs. However, lodgements cannot be accepted electronically if the TFN is not quoted.

## A reporting party or an Intermediary who is **not** a registered agent, is lodging via SBR using an AUSkey assigned to an **Individual**
The statement that the reporting party or Intermediary who is not a registered agent is declaring:
> “I declare that the information transmitted in this <ATO Product> is true and correct and that I am authorised to make this declaration”.

The text describing the way that they are ‘making’ the declaration by ‘signing’ it in a particular way shall include reference to signing with the AUSkey.
For example:
> “Tick this box to sign this declaration with the AUSkey you used to log in.”

Note: Shortening this statement to “Tick this box to sign this declaration” would not be acceptable as it does not state the identity of the reporting party or Intermediary who is not a registered agent and is making the declaration.

## A reporting party or an Intermediary who is **not** a registered agent, is lodging via SBR using an AUSkey assigned to a **device**

The statement that the reporting party or Intermediary who is not a registered agent is declaring:

> “I declare that the information transmitted in this <ATO Product> is true and correct and that I am authorised to make this declaration.”

The text describing the way that they are ‘making’ the declaration by ‘signing’ it in a particular way shall include reference to signing with the AUSkey for the device and the field giving a unique user identifier.
For example:

> “Tick this box to sign this declaration with the AUSkey used by this software and your full name inserted above.”

Note: Shortening this statement to “Tick this box to sign this declaration” would not be acceptable as it does not state the identity of the reporting party or Intermediary who is not a registered agent and is making the declaration.
The user identifier must allow the AUSkey owner or an external auditor to uniquely identify the individual who made the declaration.
The identifier used can be specified by the AUSkey owner providing it allows identification as mentioned above. Examples of suitable identifiers include a user login, a full name, or an email address. 

## An **Intermediary** who is a registered agent is lodging via SBR using an AUSkey assigned to an **Individual**

> I have received a declaration made by the entity that the information provided to me for the preparation of this return is true and correct; and
> I am authorised by the entity to give information in this return to the Commissioner.”

For those returns and forms that do not permit schedules, the phrase ‘and its related schedule(s)’ is omitted.

The text describing the way that they are ‘making’ the declaration by ‘signing’ it in a particular way shall include reference to signing with the AUSkey.
For example:

> “Tick this box to sign this declaration with the AUSkey you used to log in.”
