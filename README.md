# api.gov.au

Makes it easier to discover electronic government services

## Current Status

api.gov.au is under development. It is currently at the beta stage, a live version can be viewed at [https://api.gov.au/](https://api.gov.au/)


## Technology

This service uses Kotlin, Spring Boot and is deployed to CloudFoundry.

## Running Locally

You will need an instance of PostgreSQL running, for example here is how to run one with Docker:

```bash
# Clone git repo
git clone https://github.com/apigovau/api-gov-au.git
cd api-gov-au/

# Build it
gradle build

# Create a PostgreSQL instance
docker run --name api-gov-au-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:9.6

# Run it
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=notprodordefault \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=postgres&password=mysecretpassword" \
BaseRepoURI=https://service-catalogue-repository.herokuapp.com/ \
    java -Xmx200m -Xss512k -jar build/libs/service-catalogue-1.0.jar
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Reusing government tools

The prototype also uses the [Australian Government Design System](https://github.com/govau/design-system-components). If you want to make any significant changes to the styling, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
